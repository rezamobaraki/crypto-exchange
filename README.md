### System Design Solution

#### **Introduction**

This document outlines the system design for an API that handles cryptocurrency purchase orders on an exchange platform.
The API facilitates cryptocurrency purchases, deducts the amount from the userâ€™s wallet, and settles purchases through
international exchanges, with special handling for small purchases under $10.

#### **Objectives**

- Provide an API to handle cryptocurrency purchase orders.
- Deduct the cost of cryptocurrency from a user's wallet.
- Settle transactions with international exchanges, ensuring orders under $10 are aggregated before settlement.
- Ensure efficient, reliable, and scalable operations using Django and Celery for asynchronous tasks.

---

### **System Architecture**

The system follows a **modular architecture**, with the following components:

- **Accounts Module**: Manages user accounts and wallets.
- **Orders Module**: Handles the creation, processing, and aggregation of purchase orders.
- **Transactions Module**: Manages deposits, withdrawals, and other financial transactions.
- **Exchanges Module**: Interfaces with international exchanges for cryptocurrency settlements.
- **Redis and Celery**: Handles asynchronous task management, including order processing and aggregation logic.

#### Application Servers (Django)

- Processes API requests (e.g., placing orders, wallet management).
- Implements business logic for cryptocurrency purchases.

#### Caching Layer (Redis)

- Stores frequently accessed data (e.g., cryptocurrency prices, wallet balances).
- Implements rate limiting and session management.

#### Database Cluster (PostgreSQL)

- Primary data store for users, wallets, orders, and transaction statistics.
- *Implements sharding for horizontal scaling (e.g., by user ID or cryptocurrency).

#### Message Queue (Redis)

- Facilitates asynchronous communication between components (e.g., processing orders).
- Ensures reliable message delivery for background tasks.

#### Celery Workers

- Process background tasks (e.g., updating order statistics, handling transactions).
- Handle computationally intensive operations asynchronously.

---


### Consistency and CAP Theorem Considerations
The system prioritizes **Consistency (C)** and **Partition Tolerance (P)** from the CAP theorem, ensuring strong consistency to guarantee the accuracy of transactions and wallet balances. This design choice minimizes the risk of double-spending and maintains a reliable understanding of user funds.

- I consider **Eventual consistancy** for background processes (aggregate orders) that are implemented to ensure that data eventually converges to a consistent state, using strategies like asynchronous updates and reconciliation processes.


### Fault Tolerance and Reliability
- **Data Replication**
  - Multi-region database replication is employed for disaster recovery, ensuring that the system can recover quickly from failures.
  - Read replicas are used to enhance read performance and reduce latency, allowing for faster access to frequently requested data.

- **Monitoring and Alerting**
  - Comprehensive monitoring is established using tools such as Prometheus and Grafana, providing real-time insights into system performance.
  - Alerts are configured for critical system metrics and error rates to promptly address issues before they affect users.

### Additional Considerations
- **Security Measures**: Given the financial nature of the platform, robust security protocols, including multi-factor authentication and encryption, are implemented to safeguard user data.
- **Transaction Integrity**: Strong mechanisms are in place to validate transactions and ensure their integrity, further enhancing user trust in the platform.

---

### **Key Components**

#### **Accounts**

- **User Model**: Each user has a unique wallet that tracks their available balance. Users can deposit and withdraw
  funds.
- **Wallet Model**: Each user has a wallet with a balance in a single currency (e.g., USD). For simplicity, no
  multi-coin wallets are considered in this design.

#### **Orders**

- **Order Model**: Tracks cryptocurrency purchase requests, including the cryptocurrency type, amount, total price, and
  the state of the order (e.g., pending, completed).
- **Order Processing**: Orders are created when users submit purchase requests. Based on the total order value, orders
  either:
    - Are processed immediately for amounts above $10.
    - Are aggregated and processed later for amounts below $10.

#### **Transactions**

- **Transaction Model**: Manages deposits and withdrawals, recording the amount, type (deposit or withdrawal), and the
  related order, if applicable.
- **WalletService**: Handles updates to wallet balances when purchases or deposits occur.

#### **Exchanges**

- **ExchangeService**: Acts as a placeholder for making real HTTP requests to an international exchange. It supports
  buying cryptocurrency in bulk for multiple orders.
- **Aggregated Purchases**: When orders are under `$10`, multiple purchases are aggregated and settled with the exchange
  once the cumulative total reaches $10 or
  more.

---

### **Core Workflow**

#### **Cryptocurrency Purchase**

1. **Request**: A user submits an API request to purchase a cryptocurrency.
2. **Validation**:
    - The system checks the userâ€™s balance and verifies they have sufficient funds.
    - If funds are insufficient, an error is returned.
3. **Order Creation**:
    - An order is created with details such as the cryptocurrency, amount, and total price.
    - The userâ€™s wallet is debited.
4. **Order Processing**:
    - If the total price is below the aggregation threshold ($10), the order is queued for aggregation.
    - If the price is above the threshold, the `buy_from_exchange` method is invoked immediately.
5. **Aggregation Handling**:
    - Small orders are aggregated using Redis. Once the cumulative order value reaches the threshold, the system
      triggers a bulk purchase from the exchange.
6. **Exchange Settlement**:
    - The `buy_from_exchange` method interacts with the international exchange to settle the purchase.

```

### Data Flow and Consistency Model

The system implements an eventual consistency model to ensure high availability. Here's how data flows through the
system:

#### Authentication (Login & Register)

- User submits a login or registration request.
- API Gateway validates the request and generates JWT tokens.
- Tokens are stored in the client for future requests.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant U as User
    participant A as API Gateway
    participant D as Django App
    participant US as UserService
    participant WS as WalletService
    participant DB as Database
    U ->> A: Register New User
    A ->> D: Forward Request
    D ->> US: Create User
    US ->> DB: Save User
    DB -->> US: User Saved
    US ->> WS: Create Wallet
    WS ->> DB: Save Wallet
    DB -->> WS: Wallet Saved
    WS -->> US: Wallet Created
    US -->> D: User and Wallet Created
    D -->> A: Registration Complete
    A -->> U: User Created with Wallet
```

#### Withdraw and deposit operations:

- Wallet balances are updated in the database.
- Transactions are recorded in the database.
- Wallet balances are recalculated and cached in Redis.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant U as User
    participant A as API Gateway
    participant WV as WalletViewSet
    participant WDS as WalletDepositSerializer
    participant WS as WalletService
    participant TS as TransactionService
    participant DB as Database
    U ->> A: PATCH /wallet/deposit/
    A ->> WV: Forward Request
    WV ->> WDS: Validate Data
    WDS ->> WS: Deposit Amount
    WS ->> DB: Update Balance (Atomic)
    DB -->> WS: Balance Updated
    WS ->> TS: Record Transaction
    TS ->> DB: Save Transaction
    DB -->> TS: Transaction Saved
    TS -->> WS: Transaction Recorded
    WS -->> WDS: Deposit Successful
    WDS -->> WV: Return Updated Wallet
    WV -->> A: Return Response
    A -->> U: Deposit Confirmed
```

#### User submits a purchase order:

- API Gateway validates the request and applies rate limiting.
- Application server processes the order and performs initial validation.
- Order details are temporarily stored in Redis (pending orders).
- Acknowledgment is sent back to the user.

#### Background processing:

- Celery worker processes aggregated order or normal orders from Redis.
- Updates are applied to the PostgreSQL database in batches.
- Wallet balances and order statistics are recalculated and cached in Redis.

#### Read operations:

- Frequently accessed data (e.g., cryptocurrency prices) is served from Redis cache.
- Less frequent queries are served directly from the PostgreSQL database.

### Asynchronous Processing

- **Task: process_large_order**: Handles immediate purchase orders where the total price exceeds \$10.
- **Task: process_aggregate_orders**: Handles order aggregation and initiates purchase when cumulative orders surpass \$10.

```python

@shared_task
def process_aggregate_orders(*, order_id, crypto_name, new_total_price):
    """
    This function processes aggregate orders using Redis Lock to handle concurrency 
    and Redis Pipeline to ensure atomicity of the Redis operations.
    """

    redis_name = RedisNameTemplates.aggregate_orders(crypto_name=crypto_name)
    lock = RedisClient.lock(f"{redis_name}:lock", timeout=settings.LOCK_TIMEOUT)  # Create a Redis lock

    try:
        # Acquiring the Redis lock (blocking until the lock is acquired)
        if lock.acquire(blocking=True):
            with RedisClient.pipeline() as pipe:
                # Use pipeline for atomic operations
                pipe.hincrbyfloat(redis_name, "total_price", float(new_total_price))
                pipe.rpush(f"{redis_name}:order_ids", order_id)
                pipe.execute()  # Execute all the pipelined commands atomically

            # Fetch the updated total price from Redis
            updated_total_price = Decimal(RedisClient.hget(redis_name, "total_price") or 0)

            if updated_total_price >= settings.AGGREGATION_THRESHOLD:
                # Fetch all the order IDs associated with this batch from Redis
                order_ids = RedisClient.lrange(f"{redis_name}:order_ids", 0, -1)

                # Execute the exchange buy process in an atomic transaction
                with transaction.atomic():
                    ExchangeService.buy_from_exchange(crypto_name=crypto_name, amount=updated_total_price)
                    Order.objects.filter(id__in=order_ids).update(state=OrderStates.COMPLETED)

                # Clean up Redis keys for the current batch of aggregated orders
                RedisClient.delete(redis_name)
                RedisClient.delete(f"{redis_name}:order_ids")

    except LockError:
        # Handle failure to acquire the lock
        print("Failed to acquire the Redis lock. Retrying...")
        process_aggregate_orders.delay(order_id=order_id, crypto_name=crypto_name, new_total_price=new_total_price)

    finally:
        # Ensure that the lock is always released, even if an error occurs
        lock.release()
```
---

### **Aggregation Logic**

#### **Redis Usage**

Redis is used to store aggregated orders:

- Redis tracks the total amount and total price for each cryptocurrency.
- Once the cumulative value of aggregated orders reaches the threshold ($10), the system triggers a bulk purchase.

#### **Periodic Check**

A periodic task scans Redis for partially aggregated orders. If any orders exceed the threshold, they are processed in
bulk.

### **Data Models**

#### **Base Model**

```python
class BaseModel(models.Model):
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
    updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)

    class Meta:
        abstract = True
```

#### **Wallet Model**

```python
class Wallet(BaseModel):
    user = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    balance = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2, default=0.00)
```

#### **CryptoCurrency Model**

```python
class CryptoCurrency(BaseModel):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=10, unique=True)
    price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
```

#### **Transaction Model**

```python
class Transaction(BaseModel):
    wallet = models.ForeignKey(Wallet, on_delete=models.DO_NOTHING, related_name="transactions")
    type = models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=TransactionTypes.choices)
    amount = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
    content_type = models.ForeignKey(ContentType, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    object_id = models.PositiveIntegerField()
    content_object = GenericForeignKey("content_type", "object_id")

    class Meta:
        indexes = [
            models.Index(fields=["content_type", "object_id"]),
        ]

```

#### **Order Model**

```python
class Order(BaseModel):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.DO_NOTHING)
    crypto = models.ForeignKey(CryptoCurrency, on_delete=models.DO_NOTHING)
    amount = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=8)
    total_price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=10, decimal_places=2)
    state = models.CharField(max_length=10, choices=OrderStates.choices, default=OrderStates.PENDING)
    is_aggregated = models.BooleanField(default=False)
```

---

### **Scalability and Performance**

#### **Asynchronous Task Processing**

- Celery handles order processing and interaction with the exchange. Tasks are dispatched for both immediate and
  aggregated purchases.

#### **Redis for Aggregation**

- Redis ensures efficient storage and retrieval of partial order data, allowing for fast lookups and atomic updates to
  aggregated orders.

---

### **Security Considerations**

- **Authentication**: Token-based authentication (JWT) ensures that only authenticated users can place orders.
- **Atomic Transactions**: All wallet updates and order creations are performed within atomic database transactions to
  prevent race conditions and ensure data integrity.
- **Fraud Detection**: Implement fraud detection mechanisms to identify suspicious activities and prevent unauthorized
  access.
- **Rate Limiter**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the API and protect against DDoS attacks.
    - Implement user-based rate limiting at the API Gateway level (e.g., 1000 requests per hour).
    - Implement endpoint-specific rate limits to prevent abuse.

---

### Scalability and Performance Optimizations

- *Horizontal Scaling
    - Application servers can be scaled horizontally behind the load balancer.
    - Database read replicas can be added to handle increased read traffic.

- Caching Strategy
    - *Use Read-Through and Write-Through caching for improved performance.
    - Use cache-aside pattern for other frequently accessed data.
        1. **Read Operation**:
            - Check if the data is in the cache.
            - If found, return it.
            - If not found, load it from the database, store it in the cache, and return it.
        2. **Write Operation**:
            - Write the data to the database.
            - Invalidate or update the cache to ensure consistency.

- *Database Sharding
    - Implement horizontal sharding based on user ID or cryptocurrency.
    - Use consistent hashing for efficient data distribution.

- Asynchronous Processing
    - Offload computationally intensive tasks to Celery workers.

## Performance and Scalability

The system is designed to scale efficiently:

1. **Caching**: Redis caches cryptocurrency prices and wallet balances to minimize database load.
2. **Asynchronous Processing**: Celery processes background tasks to maintain responsiveness.
3. **Rate Limiting**: Custom throttles prevent abusive behavior.
4. **Dockerized**: Fully containerized for scalability and ease of deployment.

---

## Future Improvements

1. **Enhanced Fraud Detection**: Add machine learning algorithms for better fraud detection.
2. **Real-Time Updates**: Introduce WebSockets or gRPC for real-time updates on cryptocurrency prices.
3. **Database Sharding**: Shard the database to handle large datasets efficiently.
4. **CDN Integration**: Implement a CDN for serving static files to reduce load.
